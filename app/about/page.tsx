          Welcome to GoBike! We&apos;re not just another brand; we are a community born from a passion for adventure, family, and the pure joy of riding. Our journey began with a simple mission: to create the <strong><a href="https://gobike.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best kids electric bike</a></strong> in Australia.

            <h2>Founded by Two Dads, Fuelled by Fun</h2>
            <p>
              As two mates from the Macarthur Region, NSW, our story started in our own backyards. We saw the excitement in our kids&apos; eyes as they rode their first bikes (shoutout to STACYC!). We became addicted to modifying them, making them faster, better, and more fun.
            </p>
            <p>
              This weekend hobby quickly grew into a passion. We realised we could build our own brand—one that blended thrilling performance with the safety every parent demands. In 2023, GoBike was born.
